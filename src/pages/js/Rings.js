                     <p>Anatomical Tolerance was a project which involved producing three rings demonstrating the notion of being "minimum, maximum and ideal‚Äù sized. These rings were created using the CAD program Fusion 360 and were produced using the Stratasys J750 3D Printer. One of the rings was also sent to a US-based company called Shapeways who produced the ring using any material of our choice. The project specifically looked into creating designs which best utilised the printer's colour and material capabilities.

                    <h1>DESIGN SUMMARY</h1>
                    <p>For this project, I wanted to create rings that I could potentially wear on a regular basis. I focused on what I liked in a ring and also heavily considered the printer's capabilities / limitations throughout the entirety of my design process.</p>
                    <p>For the design of the rings themselves, I wanted to focus on using the geometric pattern and try to implement it in a variety of ways - whether that be through colour, variation of materials or inserts / ridges. </p>
                    <p>As a part of this project's hand-in, I decided to present my work through a visual booklet which briefly explains each design and elegantly showcases my work through photography and 3D renders. The booklet was created using the programs Keyshot (producing 3D renders), Photoshop (editing images) and InDesign (designed layout of Booklet).</p>
